## This project is meant to give me an understanding of what I will be doing as a junior developer once I complete the bootcamp. The project involves taking code written before HTML5 (with many uses of divs) and turning those divs into other semantic html elements such as sections, articles, and asides. In addition to merging divs into different semantics to make the code look cleaner, the project allows the code to be more concise while still maintaining its functionality. Adding "alt" tags to any image in the code will also allow those with disabilities or the inability to view the website to use code readers to access the site and give an idea of what the img tag is.
